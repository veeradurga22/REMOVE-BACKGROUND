# REMOVE-BACKGROUND
This python project is to perform to remove background of image

## Modules Used
### 1. rembg

Rembg is a Python library used for removing the background of an image. It leverages a deep learning model trained specifically for this task. The name "Rembg" stands for "Remove Background."

The Rembg library is based on the concept of semantic segmentation, which involves labeling the pixels of an image to distinguish the foreground (object of interest) from the background. It uses a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) model that has been trained on a large dataset of images with annotated foreground and background regions.

By using Rembg in Python, you can automate the process of removing the background from an image, which is particularly useful in applications such as image editing, object recognition, and computer vision tasks. The library provides a simple API that allows you to pass an image as input and obtain an output image with the background removed.
### 2. PIL
   
PIL stands for Python Imaging Library. It is a widely used library in Python for performing various image processing tasks. PIL provides a comprehensive set of functions and classes for image manipulation, including image loading, saving, resizing, cropping, filtering, and more.

PIL allows you to open, manipulate, and save different image file formats, such as JPEG, PNG, BMP, and GIF. It provides a simple and intuitive interface for performing common image operations, making it popular among developers and researchers working with images in Python.
### 3. tkinter

Tkinter is a standard Python library used for creating graphical user interfaces (GUIs). It provides a set of modules and classes that allow developers to build desktop applications with interactive windows, buttons, menus, text boxes, and other GUI elements.
