# Python Background Removal Application with Tkinter

The following code showcases a graphical user interface (GUI) implemented using the Tkinter library in Python. This GUI allows users to upload an image and remove its background using the rembg library.

The main components of the application include:

## Image Upload:

The user can click the "Upload" button to open a file dialog and select an image file.
The selected image file path is stored in the filename variable.
The file path is displayed in the GUI using a label.

## Background Removal:

After uploading an image, the user can click the "Remove" button to initiate the background removal process.
The Remove() function is called, which performs the following steps:
Loads the selected image using the Image.open() function from the PIL library.
Applies background removal using the rembg.remove() function from the rembg library.
Saves the resulting image with a modified filename (prefixed with "Remove_bg_").
Displays the resulting image using the default image viewer.
Note: The code assumes that the necessary libraries (rembg, PIL, filedialog, messagebox) have been imported correctly and installed in the Python environment.
## Modules Used
### 1. rembg

Rembg is a Python library used for removing the background of an image. It leverages a deep learning model trained specifically for this task. The name "Rembg" stands for "Remove Background."

The Rembg library is based on the concept of semantic segmentation, which involves labeling the pixels of an image to distinguish the foreground (object of interest) from the background. It uses a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) model that has been trained on a large dataset of images with annotated foreground and background regions.

By using Rembg in Python, you can automate the process of removing the background from an image, which is particularly useful in applications such as image editing, object recognition, and computer vision tasks. The library provides a simple API that allows you to pass an image as input and obtain an output image with the background removed.
### 2. PIL
   
PIL stands for Python Imaging Library. It is a widely used library in Python for performing various image processing tasks. PIL provides a comprehensive set of functions and classes for image manipulation, including image loading, saving, resizing, cropping, filtering, and more.

PIL allows you to open, manipulate, and save different image file formats, such as JPEG, PNG, BMP, and GIF. It provides a simple and intuitive interface for performing common image operations, making it popular among developers and researchers working with images in Python.
### 3. tkinter

Tkinter is a standard Python library used for creating graphical user interfaces (GUIs). It provides a set of modules and classes that allow developers to build desktop applications with interactive windows, buttons, menus, text boxes, and other GUI elements.
