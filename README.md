# REMOVE-BACKGROUND
This python project is to perform to remove background of image
in this I had used  3 modules
## 1. rembg

Rembg is a Python library used for removing the background of an image. It leverages a deep learning model trained specifically for this task. The name "Rembg" stands for "Remove Background."

The Rembg library is based on the concept of semantic segmentation, which involves labeling the pixels of an image to distinguish the foreground (object of interest) from the background. It uses a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) model that has been trained on a large dataset of images with annotated foreground and background regions.

By using Rembg in Python, you can automate the process of removing the background from an image, which is particularly useful in applications such as image editing, object recognition, and computer vision tasks. The library provides a simple API that allows you to pass an image as input and obtain an output image with the background removed.
## 2. PIL
